About Us
--------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Trivial Hero is a creative venture. We try not to take ourselves too seriously, though we are super important. Our story is of course extremely unique and enthralling: Basically, some dudes that played instruments met in high school and started writing songs together. Some dudes left to do other things, but some dudes stayed. This is the music of the dudes that stayed... For a more extensive biography, keep reading:

When A.J. and Phillip met while attending a private high school in Las Vegas, NV, A.J. was looking to start a band and Phillip was already in one. They often found themselves performing together for various reasons at their high school (choir band, theater, music theory classes, etc.). They eventually began writing songs together with other boys from their high school, forming the basis for A Trivial Hero.

Both A.J. and Phillip stayed in Las Vegas to attend university, while other members pursued their educations in other places. The lineup changed several times, but at its core were the melodies, lyrics, and progressions written by A.J. driven by the fast and adaptive drums created by Phillip. The band performed at several local bars and small events around Las Vegas for several years, but playing live became difficult without a steady lineup.

They eventually turned their attention towards recording. Learning the ins and outs of getting the songs they were playing to translate onto recorded tracks proved more difficult than it initially seemed as the duo took on the task of recording on their own within their own homes. They became the engineers, producers, writers, and performers of their music, and while it was a slower process and would never produce the same quality of sound as a professional, it was far more rewarding.

As the two have continued to write and record together, A.J. has taken steps toward fulfilling a promise made to himself a long time ago. He is currently preparing to pack up and tour with his guitar, playing any place that people are willing to listen. As part of this preparation, he is recording and releasing several acoustic albums to make the music available in some capacity to any interested.
