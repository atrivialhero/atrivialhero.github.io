These guys do such a great job supporting the music scene out in Vegas, and not just for punk rock. They do some awesome things interacting both with local acts as well as large, out of state acts.

Definitely check out all the great things Punks in Vegas are doing on their <a href="http://www.punksinvegas.com" target="_blank">Website</a>.

Destinations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are random, possibly under the radar visits I made on my roadtrip that I would recommend to all travelers out there.

***The Pacific Coast Highway***
If you are traveling through any of the states along the Pacific Ocean, it is well worth it to take a strecth fo the Pacific Coast Highway, or the PCH for short. It will add time to your travel, but it will also add beauty and wonder. This road traces the coast so you are driving right along the water, winding around cliffs and through redwood forests. Stop at Big Sur and look out at the horizon to feel the vastness of our world. <a href="http://www.pacific-coast-highway-travel.com" target="_blank">More information here</a>.

***Powell's Books***
This huge bookstore in downtown Portland is an avid reader's wet dream. An entire city block and multiple stories weave through every genre of book imaginable. Learn all about the magic <a href="http://www.powells.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

***The Experience Music Project***
This museum in Seattle is right next door to the Space Needle, and in my opinion, it is much more worth the visit than the Space Needle is. The EMP provides a hands-learning experience that thrusts visitors into the vibrant Seattle music scene. Learn what you can experience <a href="http://www.empmuseum.org" target="_blank">here</a>.

***Beacon Rock***
There is tons of great hiking in the Pacific Northwest, but a fairly simple one that gets you amazing views is Beacon Rock. This large rock right on the Oregon-Washington border can be summitted in under half an hour if you hustle and it provides an awesome perspective filled with green. Read all about it <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/474/Beacon-Rock" target="_blank">here</a>.

***Ben and Jerry's Tour Factory***
I was in the middle of Vermont without a clue what to do when a friend suggested I tour the Ben and Jerry's factory. I had no idea it was in Vermont. I drove there immediately and bought a ticket for the next tour. $4.00 got me a half hour tour of the factory that taught me all about the company and its history (it's a really cool company too!) and then the tour ends in their "Laboratory" where they create ice cream flavors. You get a sample of an experimental flavor of ice cream that changes daily. How can anyone say "no" to that? Check it out <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/about-us/factory-tours" target="_blank">here</a>.

***The Dartmouth Campus***

They have more information <a href="http://www.visitnj.org/nj/beaches" target="_blank">here</a>.

Food

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are various, delicious foods I ate throughout my travels that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys eating... so basically everyone.

***Li'l Woody's***
Honestly, the BEST burger I have ever had in my life was from this restaurant and it was called the Fig and Pig. You can also try their signature dipping sauce called "Crack" which is a tiny milkshake to dip your fries in. Check out <a href="http://lilwoodys.com" target="_blank">Li'l Woody's</a>.

***BRGR***
If the Fig and Pig from Li'l Woody's is the best burger I've ever had, this is the second best. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the BRGR Bar serves great gourmet burgers. The Button Buster or the King Salmon are excellent choices. See what else they got <a href="http://brgrpgh.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

***Eggslut***
Awesome food from an unexpected source in downtown Los Angeles. If you like breakfast (and any person that doesn't is missing out) Eggslut serves some tasty sandwiches. <a href="http://www.eggslut.com/#about" target="_blank">Website</a> here.

***Piroshky***
These delightful Russian pastries can be found all over Seattle, Washington. I honestly do not know why they aren't served all voer America because they are delicious. The most popular bakery for them can be found <a href="http://www.piroshkybakery.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

***Crab Cakes at Lexington Market***
I'm not sure how well Maryland does football, but the crab cakes are absolutely on point. They are humongous and full of crab instead of being a ball of breading sprinkled with crab pieces. Complete with the Old Bay taste synonymous with Maryland food. Read about these award winning creations <a href="http://www.faidleyscrabcakes.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

***Pie Face***
It blows my mind that this Australian staple hasn't made its way across the pond in a stronger way. These pies are filled with various meats and cheeses and flavors and goodness. The only place I know of that has a strong presence of these "Aussie Pies" is in New York City. This chain started in Australia and has moved into NYC. If you are in the New York area, get youself some <a href="http://piefacenyc.com" target="_blank">Pie Face</a>.

***Lou's Restaurant***
This cafe/diner just off the Dartmouth campus is famous for its crueller French toast. <a href="http://lousrestaurant.net" target="_blank">here</a>.

***Ray's Hellburger***

***Rude Boy Cookies***
In Albuquerque, New Mexico, right by the University campus, there are lots of bars and restaurants creating a fun, youthful environment. Rude Boy Cookies is among this strip of food and offers a unique dessert to follow any meal. They have a plethora of gourmet cookies and a "milk bar" where you create different flavors of milk by mix in anything from caramel to banana to mint. See all their wonder <a href="https://rudeboycookies.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

***POPS***
This is a classic stop on the famous Route 66 in Oklahoma between Tulsa and Oklahoma City. It has different sodas from all over the world and a classic diner menu. If you find yourself in the area, at least stop to get a picture by the iconic soda bottle by the road. They have their own <a href="http://www.route66.com" target="_blank">website</a>.

***Lobster Rolls and Whoopie Pies***
So if you are going to Maine, you have to eat Lobster. It is pretty much a rule. Their lobster is delicious, and you can go to a wide variety of places to get your fix. But a lesser known food tip is the Whoopie Pie. These large desserts are served throughout the state. They are like two huge pieces of cake with a creamy icing sandwiched in the middle. It's enough calories to last you a few days, but it is delicious. I got mine from <a href="http://www.wickedwhoopies.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
