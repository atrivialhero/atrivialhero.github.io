***Open Mic Across America Entry July 17, 2014***
----------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have learned one thing on the road, it is how to be a good houseguest." I received this compliment yesterday, and it meant the world to me. I want to be the best houseguest I can be. These people are opening up their homes to me simply out of the kindness of their hearts. It is not enough to express my gratitude in words. They need to see it, feel it through my actions. It may seem simple to them, as so many of them have said, to have me stay for a few days, but it makes such a huge difference for me. They are making my life simple and happy. The least I can do is return the favor. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reached Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania now, after a trying few day stretch. Certain frustrations have started to creep into my travel, but I cannot let them get to me. Confusing roads or unfortunate circumstances at open mics cannot affect my mood, cannot affect myself. Yesterday in the midst of my "troubles" (I don't really think I can qualify them as such) I looked up to the sky and just laughed. I said out loud to myself, "If these are the challenges, I'm still here. I'm still going. If this is the roadblock that is getting thrown in front of me, I'm not turning around so let's see what's next." It was probably dumb to challenge the universe like that, because my next few hours were filled with even more challenges. I persevered, with lots of swearing, and ended up at my open mic in an old and run down area of Pittsburgh. I played an ok set, but my voice was tired, causing me to come in flat on a few notes. Disappointing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were still excited to hear I was from across the country and kept me on the stage for awhile after my set, throwing out questions about my travels and influences. When I mentioned that I was a Penguins fan, one girl accused me of claiming similar things in each city I go to, that I'd go to Philadelphia and say I was a Flyers fan. I couldn't help it, it was instinct, "FUCK the Flyers." My comment drew loud applause, but I felt foolish for my outburst of hateful words. I stepped off the stage in shame and talked with various people about my travels. I met a group of travelers from Florida whose look fit the bill of wanderer more than my own does. Their dreadlocks and dirt encrusted skin made me wonder if I'd ever get to that point. If I could ever live so free from the eyes of society as to let my physical appearance go. I'll admit that I still have quite a bit of vanity, even on the road. I work out every day and hate wrinkles in my clothes. I post pictures and video clips that display me in a good light, and I want people to notice. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel bad for that, but it is true. I do want people to notice. Both for my sake and theirs. A selfish side of me wants them to notice because it would be nice to be recognized for what I'm doing, maybe even to receive a tangible reward in the form of a following or financial backing, but I also want people to notice because I think that I can help them. I think that they can learn from me. Maybe that is cocky to say, but I believe it to be true. I think that if people took notice of what I'm doing and saying, they might be able to find a little bit more happiness in their lives, and that is what keeps me going.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have arrived in Chicago, Illinois. The reach of my friends back home continues to aid me in ways that I am unbelievably grateful for. I recently talked with someone about how lucky I am to have received so much kindness throughout my journey this far. The person I was speaking with said that it is a reflection of myself. I can only hope that is accurate. People have been so good to me that I have no proper way to express gratitude or repay them. So instead I just work to be worthy of it. Worthy of them. I strive to be the best being that I can in every way that I can think of. How can I be kinder? More honest? More giving? More able? I want to build myself both inside and out so that I have more to share with the world. I want to share it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy for people who are presently in a good, happy place to say that everything happens for a reason. To say that they are exactly where they are supposed to be. They can look back on their hardest trials and say, "Yes, but they have led me to here, to this place of happiness, so I needed them."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But true understanding belongs to those who currently find themselves in pain or suffering and still can say that they are exactly where they are supposed to be. That their anger and sadness is necessary. That everything is happening as it should. If something bad happens to someone, and they learn from it to do better next time, then that is why it was required for them to endure failure - so they could learn. This person is on the path to happiness. However, if a person makes a mistake, but learns nothing, instead continuing to make similar mistakes, then where that person is supposed to be is in suffering, in pain, in anger, in sadness. I can say confidently that we are all where we belong, but I cannot say that we all belong in happiness. We belong in happiness if we choose to belong there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, do not mistake the fact that it should be easy for happy people to recognize the worth of their troubles for the notion that all happy people do value their past troubles. Their happiness might be where they are meant to be because it could lead to their fall. Sometimes, people need to have something and lose it before they ever appreciate what having happiness means. The next time they achieve it, it will mean so much more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been too long since I have checked in. I sit in a cafe in St. Paul, MN, pondering my world and my choices. I find myself happy on the road, performing my songs for audiences of varying sizes. It is nice to receive compliments and inquiries about where they can find my music, but it is nicer to just play. The things that happen when I step off the stage are good, but nothing can compare to the feeling of strumming and singing, of expressing my thoughts, of believing my words as I put them out into the universe. It is nothing short of amazing. I am aware that some day I will have to face the realities of home. That prospect scares me. For the time being, I am just going to enjoy the opportunity I have in front of me. I have time to write and create. It shall not go wasted:

A wish for a different past is a wish for a different present. If you are happy with your present, there was no other way to get there than the path that you took. If you are NOT happy with your present, you need to change your behaviors now so that when the future becomes the present, and the present becomes the past, you can be happy with where you are.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello World! For those of you who have not yet viewed the above video, my name is A.J. and I am a singer/songwriter from Las Vegas, Nevada currently driving around the U.S. to play open mics and small venues for fun. I realized some time ago that if I never took the opportunity to drive around and play music because I love it, then I would grow up to hate myself. I am lucky enough to not currently have anything holding me back, and am blessed enough to have awesome people in my life that make the whole thing much easier. So I gave myself a year to save up and touch base with family and friends, and then in March 2014, I quit my job.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started driving towards the end of April, and today I arrived in Seattle, Washington. It has been an amazing trip so far, and I am only looking forward to what will happen from here. I will check in more often to update on what is happening around me. For those who know me personally, I promise I will be safe and share the good stories. For musicians, I promise I will give you the low-down on different city's music scenes and open mics. For venues, I promise I will be honest in representing your facilities and staff. For travelers, I promise to give you my tips for the road and for hidden gems along the way. For anybody else... ummm I'm not sure what you're doing here, but I will try to be entertaining nonetheless. I would love to share my journey with all of you. Maybe I can convince you to take a risk or avoid a mistake. So check back in sometime. Feel free to email or facebook or instagram or whatever. Thanks for reading. Live every day like it's your first.
   
   -A.J.
