***Open Mic Across America Entry July 2, 2014***
----------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been too long since I have checked in. I sit in a cafe in St. Paul, MN, pondering my world and my choices. I find myself happy on the road, performing my songs for audiences of varying sizes. It is nice to receive compliments and inquiries about where they can find my music, but it is nicer to just play. The things that happen when I step off the stage are good, but nothing can compare to the feeling of strumming and singing, of expressing my thoughts, of believing my words as I put them out into the universe. It is nothing short of amazing. I am aware that some day I will have to face the realities of home. That prospect scares me. For the time being, I am just going to enjoy the opportunity I have in front of me. I have time to write and create. It shall not go wasted:

A wish for a different past is a wish for a different present. If you are happy with your present, there was no other way to get there than the path that you took. If you are NOT happy with your present, you need to change your behaviors now so that when the future becomes the present, and the present becomes the past, you can be happy with where you are.


***Open Mic Across America Entry June 5, 2014***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello World! For those of you who have not yet viewed the above video, my name is A.J. and I am a singer/songwriter from Las Vegas, Nevada currently driving around the U.S. to play open mics and small venues for fun. I realized some time ago that if I never took the opportunity to drive around and play music because I love it, then I would grow up to hate myself. I am lucky enough to not currently have anything holding me back, and am blessed enough to have awesome people in my life that make the whole thing much easier. So I gave myself a year to save up and touch base with family and friends, and then in March 2014, I quit my job.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started driving towards the end of April, and today I arrived in Seattle, Washington. It has been an amazing trip so far, and I am only looking forward to what will happen from here. I will check in more often to update on what is happening around me. For those who know me personally, I promise I will be safe and share the good stories. For musicians, I promise I will give you the low-down on different city's music scenes and open mics. For venues, I promise I will be honest in representing your facilities and staff. For travelers, I promise to give you my tips for the road and for hidden gems along the way. For anybody else... ummm I'm not sure what you're doing here, but I will try to be entertaining nonetheless. I would love to share my journey with all of you. Maybe I can convince you to take a risk or avoid a mistake. So check back in sometime. Feel free to email or facebook or instagram or whatever. Thanks for reading. Live every day like it's your first.
   
   -A.J.
