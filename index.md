Welcome!
--------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for visiting ATrivialHero.com! A Trivial Hero is a venture to outlet creativity, highlight underground talents from across the country (and eventually world), and inspire others to contribute to the art and love of our world. As you navigate throughout the pages, you will find an array of art through various mediums, as well as links to other great artists discovered throughout our travels. Everything is DIY and far from perfect, but the imperfection is part of what makes it beautiful. Below, you will find the music of A Trivial Hero, which is the foundation of this entire project. To keep up with more current developments, check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ATrivialHero" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/atrivialhero" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/atrivialhero" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. Enjoy!
