Welcome!
--------
Thank you for visiting ATrivialHero.com! A Trivial Hero is a venture to outlet creativity, highlight underground talents from across the country (and eventually world), and inspire others to contribute to the art and love of our world. As you navigate throughout the pages, you will find an array of art through various mediums, as well as links to other great artists discovered throughout our travels. Everything is DIY and far from perfect, but the imperfection is part of what makes it beautiful. Below, you will find the music of A Trivial Hero, which is the foundation of this entire project. To keep up with more current developments, check out Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube. Enjoy.

"Give me words. Give me books. Give me music. Find your talent and learn how to use it. To give me art; give me love. Give me art; give me love, and I swear I'll give you words. Give you books. Give you music. Refine my talent and learn how to use it. To create art; create love. Create art; create love for life."
